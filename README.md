The steps I followed in this project are :

1. Downloaded Olympics Dataset from Internet.
2. Imported Olympic_events and country_definitions into PowerBI Desktop.
3. Cleaning Data in Power Query Editor (In this case first I removed unnecessary columns from both the tables and afterwards merged both the tables using Merge Queries option based on the common NOC -> Name of Country column).
4. Applied visualizations such as Donut Chart, Matrix Chart and Ribbon Chart, Stacked Bar and Stacked Column charts, Treemap and Line Chart to get insights from the data.
5. Finally, created a report by embedding all the visuals into a single page.
